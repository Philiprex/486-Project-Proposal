College Tuition Trends Project Proposal 

 

	We are looking at college tuition data over the past decade. We are examining trends in tuition change in relation to many considerations such as inflation rates, geographic location, type of institution,
 etc. This data is all provided by the Department of Education which mandates that colleges release information regarding tuition. This is valuable information that prospective or current students can use to make
 important decisions about their education. We think that having detailed, intuitive, and interactive display of this information can make it more accessible for those students and their families. 

	The data, accessible via this link, is the Department of Education’s College Affordability and Transparency List. Each year is presented by a separate data file. The files track in the area of 3500 Title
 IV institutions throughout the US. The data contains information about the type of institution, tuition, tuition change, etc. at the individual level, and a variety of aggregate statistics. All of the data is
 tabular, and fields include categorical information about the institution type and state, nominal data for the name of the institution, and numerical data for all tuition information.  

	The data for the inflation rates can be found via this link, and is the inflation rate calculated using the consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labour Statistics. We will be transforming the
 data to be the average for the year instead of monthly. The data is tabular and has been converted to a csv file.  

 

	In 2019 an article entitled “The Rise and Fall of College Tuition Inflation” was published and specifically refers to the NCES data we are using. It is praised for its detailed breakdown of tuition prices
 based on type of institution. It mostly focuses on a broad overview of the relationship between college tuition inflation and national inflation over a large period. They found that college tuition inflation
 rates were not correlated with the rate of core inflation and presented this using two simple line plots. 

	 

	College Board published a full report on “Trends in College Pricing 2023” and the accompanying powerpoint presentation provides a variety of data visualizations that examine the inflation of tuition
 across three decades 1993-2023. It uses various data visualizations, such as tables and charts, to depict trends in tuition fees, enrollment-weighted average budgets, and inflation. The use of these
 visualizations facilitates an easier understanding of complex data; however, their effectiveness could be enhanced by incorporating interactive elements that allow viewers to explore data more deeply or by simplifying some of the more complex charts for better clarity and quicker insigh	 

	The visualization from the U.S. News & World Report clearly shows a 20-year trajectory of rising tuition costs at different types of universities. It provides a comparative look at private versus public
institutions, distinguishing between in-state and out-of-state tuition. The steep upward trends, particularly for private and in-state public tuition, are striking. However, this visualization could benefit from
additional context such as average family income growth, to assess affordability, or including net tuition costs after aid, to present a more complete financial picture for prospective students. # Project-Proposal
